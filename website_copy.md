>Use your favorite Web3 APIs in any language or platform (Rust, C#, Python, Javascript, etc)

- Friendly

>GraphQL & REST make it easy to understand and use

- Dynamic

>Decide what APIs you want to use at run-time, no build artifacts required! Just like Web2 services.

- Secure & Efficient

>Through the power of WASM, Web3 APIs execute at lightning speed, all from within a secure sandbox that can't access your app's private data.
